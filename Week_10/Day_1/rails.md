# Rails Review

- Routes
  - `config/routes.rb` is the entry point in our website
  - This is where rails decides where all of the routes go to

- Controller
  - The controller is responsible for logic that happens right before we send out response
  - Controller has actions (methods) and those methods are responsible for your routes

- Views
  - The file that is sent back to the client
  - This is our html/css layouts that get generated by the server (server side rendered)
  - Remember the action name = the view name, so that rails knows which view to send out

- Models
  - A blueprint for a table that lives in your db
  - A model is a class that comes with a lot of pre-build db methods/queries
  - Migration
    - It's a specific record of adding/deleting/creating/changing a table in the database
    - Records of migrations are kept for history purposes and we never edit history
    - If you are working on a branch, and you have added a bunch of migrations and you realized you forgot to add a col to one of the migrations, this is OK to rollback!
    - If the migrations have been added to master, and have been deployed into production, this means the migrations are now in "history" and you cannot alter them (rollback) so you will have add a new migration
